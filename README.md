# Survival-on-Titanic
A classification problem related to predicting a passenger's survival in the Titanic sinking disaster.
Started the problem by viewing and analyzing various features and their estimated effect on the dependent variable, that is 'Survival'.
Visualized each variable by means of various graphs like bar graphs, histograms, using matplotlib and seaborn libraries(Univariate Analysis).
Completed the training annd test data sets by filling in the missing values in features like age, fare, using median and mode concepts.
Performed bivariate analysis, that is analyzing each independent variable along with the dependent variable to know the effect of each.
This was done by plotting graphs of various categorical and numeric variables with Survival rate/number of each category.
Deduced the important variables that may have an effect on the target variable, thus dropping the other variables.
Finally, applied logistic regression and random forest models on the data for the classification prediction.
